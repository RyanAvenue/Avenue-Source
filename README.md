Avenue-Source
=============

This is a source that is currently in development stage. It is for making it easier to create serversite tasks in a non-technical way or a professional way. Depending on what you want.

By now I am not sure if I want to implement a subscription system that's why I wont share it yet. I will post some details in here to let you guys know what features are implemented yet and what is left to do.

Things that already work
========================
* Registration
* Validation using a Token that gets sent though an email
* Log In/Out
* Remember me Token
* A social way to go about publishing news. People that want to get news need to follow a person with administrative rights. It's like a twitter status that gets posted.
* Comments for 'Twitter statuses'
* Flash messages
* Settings for the view of the website, you can change colors and where you want the navigation to me (left/top/right/bottom)
* List users with pagination
* Small things like hide the follow button when you already follow a person
* Gulp.js

Things that needs to be done
============================
* Subscriotion system for stripe
* User roles
* Users permitions table
* Envoy Task Runner
  * Save server site scripts in Python, Perl, Curl, PHP, Java and C# - save them as methods that costumers can use
  * Give the opportunity to send out commands using a terminal looking command line
  * Set fields that people need to fill out for a set task
* System for setting up gateways, also names of something that gets send though email and stuff like that, maybe set up a site name
* SEO (Search Engine Optimization) checklist
